# clear-accounts

### :muscle: A simple app built with TypeScript to make accounts with friends easier. 
This app helps you to calculate and manage the expenses that you and your friends shared.

1. Add your friends. <br>
2. Add the expenses. <br>
3. Check who owes who. <br>
4. Make the reimbursements. <br>

### :wrench: Used tools.
\- Made with some TypeScript special features: type aliases, interfaces, member visibility, tuples, explicit types, function signatures, etc. <br>
\- It is structured with modularizing code. <br>
